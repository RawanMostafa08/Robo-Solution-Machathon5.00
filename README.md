# Robo Autonomous Car Simulation Hackathon

Welcome to the Robo team's hackathon project! We're thrilled to present our endeavor to create a completely autonomous car simulation. Our team is composed of passionate individuals eager to tackle the challenges of this hackathon and push the boundaries of what's possible with image processing, computer vision, and PID techniques.

## About the Hackathon

This hackathon is not just about coding; it's about innovation, creativity, and problem-solving. We're diving headfirst into the realm of autonomous driving, where every line of code brings us closer to a future of safer and more efficient transportation.

Our mission is ambitious: to create a simulation where a virtual car can perceive its surroundings, make decisions, and navigate autonomously. But with determination, teamwork, and a dash of ingenuity, we're confident we can rise to the challenge.

Throughout this hackathon, we'll encounter obstacles, moments of inspiration, and maybe even a few surprises. But with our diverse skill set and collaborative spirit, we're ready to tackle anything that comes our way.

So let's roll up our sleeves, fire up our IDEs, and embark on this exciting journey together. Together, we'll code, innovate, and hopefully, make a significant contribution to the field of autonomous driving.

Let's make Robo proud! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨ðŸ¤–
